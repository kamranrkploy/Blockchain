For Testing the first EndPoint i.e : /block/:blockHash follow the below steps:

(1) create a blockchain with number of blocks of your wish by hitting the /blockchain and /mine end points.
(2) now copy the hash from one of the blocks and run /block/YourHashHere.
(3) you can see the block for the requested block if the value of hash was correct.
(4) if the value of hash is incorrect you ll see a block with {block:null}.
