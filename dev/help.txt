to test the register-node end point :
use postman and select POST and use one of your node for ex :
http://localhost:3001/register-node

now select body and their chose raw and JSOn there
now write the below code and send it.

{
    "newNodeUrl": "http://localhost:3006"
}

now on your browser run http://localhost:3001/blockchain 
and you can see there that  "http://localhost:3006" is added with current node.

now to test the bulk-gegister node do the following changes in the postman:
use this method ---> http://localhost:3001/register-node-bulk
use following data in the body
{
    "allNetworkNodes": [
        "http://localhost:3002",
        "http://localhost:300s"
    ] 
}

NOTE: try youself by taking different nodes and examples and see if your blockchain is error free

for testing the entire network use register-node-bulk after your newNodeUrland send the data in postman to test the network

what we are doing here :
whenever we register a new node with one of the existing node than this new node registers itself with all the other node.

For testing the /transaction/broadcast end point do the following:
in postman first of all make sure that your everynode is connected to one another.
after that , select post and execute the above endpoint and give a dummy data.
after that go to your browser and check every node.
you ll see that the new transaction is in the pending transaction of every node.

For testing /mine endpoint (after updation)
simple connect each node to one another and then run /mine method on any of the node and check every node.
you may play around with every method and see if the blockchain is synchronous.
