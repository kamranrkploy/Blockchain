For Testing the first EndPoint i.e : /block/:blockHash follow the below steps:

(1) create a blockchain with number of blocks of your wish by hitting the /blockchain and /mine end points.
(2) now copy the hash from one of the blocks and run /block/YourHashHere.
(3) you can see the block for the requested block if the value of hash was correct.
(4) if the value of hash is incorrect you ll see a block with {block:null}.

For Testing Second EndPoint i.e : /transaction/:transactionId follow the below steps:

(1) create a blockchain with number of blocks of your wish by hitting the /blockchain and /mine end points.
(2) create some transaction from postman on this node.
(3) mine new block and copy the transactionId from one of the blocks.
(4) hit the new end point i.e : /transaction/:transactionId (replace:transactionId with the real transactionId).
(5) see the result.

for testing the last endpoint i.e /address/:address do the following

(1) Create a blockchain and add some transactions on to it using postman
(2) Hit the /address/:address endpoint and place a sender or reciever address in place of :address
(3) if the address is correct then yo can see all the transactions related to it and balance related to that address
(4) if the address used is wrong you ll see empty array with zero balance
