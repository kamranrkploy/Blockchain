to test the register-node end point :
use postman and select POST and use one of your node for ex :
http://localhost:3001/register-node

now select body and their chose raw and JSOn there
now write the below code and send it.

{
    "newNodeUrl": "http://localhost:3006"
}

now on your browser run http://localhost:3001/blockchain 
and you can see there that  "http://localhost:3006" is added with current node.

now to test the bulk-gegister node do the following changes in the postman:
use this method ---> http://localhost:3001/register-node-bulk
use following data in the body
{
    "allNetworkNodes": [
        "http://localhost:3002",
        "http://localhost:300s"
    ] 
}

NOTE: try youself by taking different nodes and examples and see if your blockchain is error free

for testing the entire network use register-node-bulk after your newNodeUrland send the data in postman to test the network

what we are doing here :
whenever we register a new node with one of the existing node than this new node registers itself with all the other node.

For testing the /transaction/broadcast end point do the following:
in postman first of all make sure that your everynode is connected to one another.
after that , select post and execute the above endpoint and give a dummy data.
after that go to your browser and check every node.
you ll see that the new transaction is in the pending transaction of every node.

For testing /mine endpoint (after updation)
simple connect each node to one another and then run /mine method on any of the node and check every node.
you may play around with every method and see if the blockchain is synchronous.

for testing the chainIsValid method run any one node and it with data accordingly,
now copy the data of your blockchain and put it in test.js as i have done.
now run node test.js

To test the Consensus Endpoint:
1) connect 5 nodes out of the 6 nodes and leave one node as it as.
2) mine some blocks on all the five connected nodes , add transactions accordingly.
3) now connect the last node with all the five other nodes 
4) its obvious that the blocks there will be different as it was not connected before
5) now run the /Consensus endpoint on this node and see what happens.
6) that's it , you are done.
7) after the sixth node also has the correct blockchain try running the /Consensus endpoint once again and see what happens.
8) we tested our entire network successfully.
